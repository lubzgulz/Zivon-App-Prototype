# Zivon-App-Prototype
The specific app, known as ‘Zivon,’ tracks energy usage of the different personae created for this project based on the different use cases each of the family members are assigned to help all of them achieve the common goal of conserving energy.  

The main aim of the project is to create an app prototype, using Figma, to encourage the reduction of energy usage by a family, using design elements and gaming interactions in order to educate users and promote energy efficiency. 

To do this, the following objectives must be met.  
- Utilize Figma to create a user-friendly app prototype. 
- Provide goal-based tasks that vary based on persona characteristics. 
- Implement multimodal gaming interactions that employ suitable modalities. 
- Ensure the application is accessible to all people, considering age groups and disabilities and how they would affect user experience.


In order to display the different people and their reasons for using the app, personas were created based around the structure of a family of four people – two parents and two children, a boy and a girl, aged 5 and 13 respectively. The key characteristics and goals for each of the personae in the "User Personae" folder in the GIT.


The storyboards for the energy-saving app prototype, designed for a family of four, were created with careful consideration of each family member's individual needs, preferences and goals. It focused on educating each member, with further additions allowing them to manage and reduce their energy consumption. While drawing the initial draft, the following unique features for each family member were considered: 
(i) Aditya (the dad) required an easy way to track family activity and manage secure bill payments, supporting his goal of saving money and energy.  
(ii) Sonia (the mom) needed to have a calendar to keep track of her busy schedule and daily tasks. Along with that, a journey tracker would be extremely helpful in monitoring her journeys carbon footprint as her goal is to spend more time hanging out with friends while still being energy efficient.  
(iii) Anjali (the 13-year-old daughter) has customizable widgets that allow her to enjoy her music in the app. Moreover, she loves cooking and wants to learn how to bake. With smart kitchen controls, she can manage appliances and listen to music hands-free. Careful consideration also needed as she suffers from poor eyesight, so the app needed to be user friendly with speech command options, along with bigger, simple, and pleasant aesthetics.  
(iv) Ashwin (the 5-year-old son) needed a gamified version of the app suitable for young kids, to learn about energy conservation in a fun and easy way to ensure retention of energy efficiency concepts.  
(v) A common feature for all family members is the smart home control system, which allows them to manage lights, air conditioning, and other appliances through the app. This was done for ease of control and access by all users. Another common feature was the ability to earn points in the app, which can be exchanged for rewards to provide extrinsic motivation for family members, with offers provided by the app for food, activities, and entertainment. The detailed tasks and interaction options that can be achieved in the app by each family member are illustrated in the "Storyboard" folder. 

The detailed app interaction info can be found in the Doc attached in the "Report" folder.
